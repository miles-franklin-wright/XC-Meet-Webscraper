# XC-Meet-Webscraper

This is a very basic scraper that is meant to work for Milesplit cross country data. It works by implementing a meet url, where each race is returned as a result URL. 
These result URLs are then cycled through,  where data is added to data.csv. 
The scraper in its current version has issues with crashes, and other issues related to varying formats of the data being scraped. 
These issues will be solved in later versions, as well as seeing a more robust version of the scraper appearing. 
Additionally, the goal will be to add track and field to the types of data obtainable.
